# cplusplus_project

This is my final project for CPSC 370 C ++ Programming.
Written by Noah Stafford

nothing special needed to run, just compile.

Program starts with being asked for a player name.
The difficulty corresponds to what enemies can spawn. Harder difficulty, more types of enemies.
The number of rooms is how many rooms the player will have to travel through to win.

The player must select a room to travel to. Upon entering a room, an enemy will spawn.
The player must fight the enemy to win. There are 3 options within fights: attack, defend, and heal.
Attacking damages the monster. Defending means that the player will take 1/3 damage next time they are hit.
Healing healts the player by 1/5th of their current health.

Battles end when either the player or the monster dies. After winning a battle, the player recieves xp and will level up once they get enough.
Chests have a chance to spawn in the room after defeating the enemy. They can contain nothing, another monster, a health potion, or a strength potion.

The player continues travelling to different rooms and fighting enemies until they die or reach the number of rooms they selected at the start of the game.
